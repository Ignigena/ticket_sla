#Acquia Support Chrome Extension

Chrome extension to monitor SLA timelines in Parature in addition to other Acquia-specific tools and enhancements.

## Install

* Find the latest version here: https://github.com/Ignigena/ticket_sla/releases
* Click the green download button which contains the packed .CRX extension for Chrome.
* Visit chrome://extensions
* Drag and drop the .CRX file you just downloaded onto that page.

## Updating

The Chrome extension will automatically check for updates every few hours.  This interval is entirely dependent on Chrome itself.  You can manually force an update to the latest version by performing the following:

* Visit chrome://extensions
* Activate the checkbox in the upper right corner labeled "Developer mode"
* Click "Update extensions now"

While there will be no indicator, Chrome is downloading the update in the background.  Depending on the speed of the connection and size of the update this may take a few seconds.
